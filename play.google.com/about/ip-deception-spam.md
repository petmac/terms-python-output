Impersonation and Intellectual Property 

##  Impersonation and Intellectual Property 

We don’t allow apps or developer accounts that impersonate other entities, brands, or otherwise infringe on intellectual property rights of others (including trademark, copyright, patent, trade secret, and other proprietary rights). We also don’t allow apps that encourage or induce infringement of intellectual property rights. 

We will respond to clear notices of alleged copyright infringement. For more information or to file a DMCA request, please visit our [ copyright procedures](https://support.google.com/legal/answer/3110420?product=androidmarket&rd=2&hl=en). 

If you are a trademark owner and you believe there is an app on Google Play that infringes on your trademark rights, we encourage you to reach out to the developer directly to resolve your concern. If you are unable to reach a resolution with the developer, please submit a trademark complaint through this [ form](https://support.google.com/legal/contact/lr_trademark?product=googleplay&vid=null). 

If you have written documentation proving that you have permission to use a third party's intellectual property in your app or store listing (such as brand names, logos and graphic assets), [contact the Google Play team](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/6320428) in advance of your submission to ensure that your app is not rejected for an Impersonation or Intellectual Property violation.

###  Impersonation 

](https://play.google.com/about/ip-deception-spam/impersonation-ip/impersonation/)

We don’t allow apps that use another app or entity’s brand, title, logo, or name in a manner that may result in misleading users. Don’t try to imply an endorsement or relationship with another entity where none exists. Impersonation can occur even if there isn’t an intent to deceive, so please be careful when referencing any brands that do not belong to you. This applies even if that brand doesn’t yet have a presence on Google Play. 

####  Here are some examples of common violations: 

  


  * Developers that falsely suggest an affiliation with another entity:

① The developer name listed for this app suggests an official relationship with Google, even though such a relationship doesn’t exist. 

  * App titles and icons that are so similar to those of existing products or services that users may be misled:

  * Apps that falsely claim to be the official app of an established entity. Titles like “Justin Bieber Official” are not allowed without the necessary permissions or rights. 

  * Apps that violate the [Android Brand Guidelines](https://developer.android.com/intl/distribute/tools/promote/brand.html).

###  Unauthorized Use of Copyrighted Content 

](https://play.google.com/about/ip-deception-spam/impersonation-ip/unauthorized-copyright/)

We don’t allow apps that infringe copyright. Modifying copyrighted content may still lead to a violation. Developers may be required to provide evidence of their rights to use copyrighted content. 

Please be careful when using copyrighted content to demonstrate the functionality of your app. In general, the safest approach is to create something that’s original. 

####  Here are some examples of copyrighted content that is often used without authorization or a legally valid reason: 

  


  * Cover art for music albums, video games, and books. 
  * Marketing images from movies, television, or video games. 
  * Artwork or images from comic books, cartoons, movies, music videos, or television. 
  * College and professional sports team logos. 
  * Photos taken from a public figure’s social media account. 
  * Professional images of public figures. 
  * Reproductions or “fan art” indistinguishable from the original work under copyright. 
  * Apps that have soundboards that play audio clips from copyrighted content. 
  * Full reproductions or translations of books that are not in the public domain.

###  Trademark Infringement 

](https://play.google.com/about/ip-deception-spam/impersonation-ip/trademark/)

We don’t allow apps that infringe on others’ trademarks. A trademark is a word, symbol, or combination that identifies the source of a good or service. Once acquired, a trademark gives the owner exclusive rights to the trademark usage with respect to certain goods or services. 

Trademark infringement is improper or unauthorized use of an identical or similar trademark in a way that is likely to cause confusion as to the source of that product. If your app uses another party’s trademarks in a way that is likely to cause confusion, your app may be suspended. 

##  Deceptive Behavior 

We don’t allow apps that attempt to deceive users. Apps must provide accurate disclosure of their functionality and should perform as reasonably expected by the user. Apps must not attempt to mimic functionality or warnings from the operating system or other apps. Any changes to device settings must be made with the user’s knowledge and consent and be easily reversible by the user.
